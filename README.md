# Signature-Forgery

The model i am using is SVM (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aM5pweoPjmNGR8-5iS6xrHJvg3dmWiZa?usp=sharing)

this is my first machine learning related project this AI i made can predict if a signature is genuine or forged (fake), this is a very simple AI. The format of the signature must be an image format

the dataset:
it is from kaggle but it seems i lost the link or the dataset has been removed, but thankfully i already downloaded it
